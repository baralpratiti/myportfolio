My Portfolio

This is my portfolio website, a text-heavy, article-oriented design built around a huge background
image (with a new parallax implementation) and scroll effects (powered by
Scrollex)

Demo images* courtesy of Unsplash, a radtastic collection of CC0 (public domain) images
that you can use for pretty much whatever.
